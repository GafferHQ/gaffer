Getting Started
===============

Gaffer's Python scripting API is fairly frugal, so learning a few fundamental concepts goes a long way. Here we'll take a quick tour through these fundamentals using Gaffer's [PythonEditor][1]. We'll see how we can enter Python code within the PythonEditor to create nodes and plugs, and edit their values and connections. We'll also see how we can use drag and drop to conveniently enter text into the PythonEditor itself.

The PythonEditor
----------------

After launching Gaffer, the PythonEditor can be found in its default location on a tab in the bottom right of the main window.

The editor is broken into two sections. The bottom field is for entering python commands, and this functions much like any other basic text editor. We'll get started right away by entering the text `print "Hello World!", script`. We can then execute the code by pressing _Ctrl+Enter_.

The top field displays output from any commands executed, so we should see the greeting we printed along with the mysterious `script` variable that we printed with it. The `script` variable references the root node of a Gaffer file, and is our gateway to further exploration.

> _Ctrl+Enter_ executes everything and clears the contents of the input field, but the commands
> can always be retrieved later by cutting and pasting them from the output field.

Nodes and plugs
---------------

The most important classes in the Gaffer API are the Nodes and Plugs which are connected together to make up a dependency graph. These are parented together in a hierarchy which nicely maps to pythonâ€™s dictionary syntax. Plugs may be parented to nodes using Python's familiar dictionary notation :

```
node = Gaffer.Node()
node["firstPlug"] = Gaffer.IntPlug()
node["secondPlug"] = Gaffer.FloatPlug()
```

If you follow along by entering the code above in the PythonEditor, you may wonder why our newly created node hasn't appeared in the NodeEditor or GraphEditor. This is because we haven't given it a parent yet, so it is not associated with any script. Let's add it to the `script` root, and select it so that it appears in the NodeEditor :

```
script.addChild( node )
script.selection().clear()
script.selection().add( node )
```

![NodeEditor image](images/nodeEditor.png)

It appeared! Exciting stuff! Nodes have a variety of methods to manipulate them after construction, so let's celebrate by using one of them to rename the node :

```
node.setName( "MyMostAwesomeNode" )
```

Editing plug values
-------------------

Our humble node doesn't do anything particularly interesting, so let's create one that can actually generate a scene. Each node type in Gaffer is a different class in Python, and lives inside a module specific to the sort of processing it performs (a full list of modules and the nodes they provide is available in the [Node Reference][2]).

For now we'll go ahead and make a Sphere :

```
import GafferScene
script.addChild( GafferScene.Sphere() )
```

This time we've added the node directly to the script without assigning it to a variable, so we don't yet have a convenient handle for the node. Fear not, we can always get an appropriate reference to a node by _Middle Dragging_ it from the GraphEditor and into the PythonEditor. As you might guess, this gives us the familiar dictionary syntax of `script["Sphere"]`. We can do the same for plugs by _Left Dragging_ them from the NodeEditor. Get the plug for controlling the radius by dragging the "Radius" label from the NodeEditor, to insert the text `script["Sphere"]["radius"]`.

Plugs are Python classes in the same way that nodes are, and have additional methods we can use for editing them. The `getValue()` method returns the current value of a plug, so we can use it to learn that the sphere has a radius of 1 :

![PythonEditor getValue() image](images/pythonEditorGetValue.png)

As you might have guessed, we can change the value using a matching `setValue()` method. Let's go ahead and set the values for a couple of the simplest plugs to demonstrate how this works :

```
script["Sphere"]["radius"].setValue( 10.5 )
script["Sphere"]["name"].setValue( "mySphere" )
```

In the same way that nodes can have child plugs, plugs themselves can have children, and they are accessed using exactly the same dictionary syntax. Gaffer makes use of plugs nested in this way to represent more complex values, such as the xyz translate, rotate and scale of the sphere. This means we can either set the plugs individually, or set several at a time using the `setValue()` method on the parent plug :

```
# Setting leaf plugs individually
script["Sphere"]["transform"]["translate"]["x"].setValue( 1 )
script["Sphere"]["transform"]["translate"]["y"].setValue( 2 )
script["Sphere"]["transform"]["translate"]["z"].setValue( 3 )

# Setting them all in one shot
script["Sphere"]["transform"]["translate"].setValue( imath.V3f( 1, 2, 3 ) )
```

> Tip : The second form is often more convenient because it is shorter, and because the `V3f` class
> provides lots of useful functionality for doing maths with vector values. As a newcomer to Gaffer
> though, it's unlikely that we could have guessed the right syntax. Here drag and drop comes to our
> rescue again - _Shift+Left Dragging_ the plug label from the NodeEditor and into the PythonEditor
> will enter the code for current value of the plug, providing a convenient syntax reference.

Making connections
------------------

As well as having values, plugs can be connected together so that values flow from one to another. We'll use the PythonEditor to create a small node network to demonstrate this.

```
meshToPoints = GafferScene.MeshToPoints()
meshToPoints["in"].setInput( script["Sphere"]["out"] )
meshToPoints["type"].setValue( "sphere" )
script.addChild( meshToPoints )
```

As before, `meshToPoints["in"]` refers to a plug that is the child of a node, but instead of setting its value with the `setValue()` method, this time we have given it an input connection with the `setInput()` method.

![MeshToPoints GraphEditor](images/meshToPointsGraphEditor.png)

Now, let's create a Camera and group it with our funky sphere thing, so that we have the beginnings of a scene we could render.

```
camera = GafferScene.Camera()
script.addChild( camera )
group = GafferScene.Group()
script.addChild( group )
# Note the use of list syntax
group["in"][0].setInput( meshToPoints["out"] )
group["in"][1].setInput( camera["out"] )
```

Until now, we've been accessing plugs and nodes by name, using Python's dictionary syntax. In the code snippet above you can see that we can also access children using Python's list syntax, and for the Group node this is particularly convenient. The Group can have any number of inputs, so the `group["in"]` plug behaves like an array, and we can access its first child with `group["in"][0]` and it's second child with `group["in"][1]`, and so on.

> Tip : The fact that some plugs are visible only in the NodeEditor and some plugs are visible only in the GraphEditor might give the false impression that only the plugs in the GraphEditor can be connected. In fact, this is not the case, and as a general rule almost any plug can be given an input connection.

Recap
-----

We've seen that Gaffer's node graphs can be constructed using a minimal set of scripting commands, and that the PythonEditor makes experimenting with these commands relatively easy by allowing nodes and plugs to be dragged and dropped directly into the code. The [Scripting Reference][3] and [PythonEditor Reference][1] sections provide a useful reminder of all we've covered in this tutorial, and additional information useful for further exploration.
