## Node Graph Performance ##

As with all VFX processes and software, a Gaffer node graph is subject to performance considerations. Everything that goes into a node graph – node types, network structure, paths, expressions – can result in undesirably slow execution. Since the causes of a slow graph might not be immediately apparent, developing a basic understanding of how Gaffer evaluates graphs, as well as the complexity pitfalls users commonly encounter, will help you make graph design choices that lead to optimum performance.
