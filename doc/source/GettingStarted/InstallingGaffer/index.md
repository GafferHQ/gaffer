# Installing Gaffer #

The Gaffer package is a self-contained directory, so you will need to manually install it, and later manually configure it, if necessary. Once extracted, the Gaffer directory contains the complete application, ready for use.

> Note :
> In keeping with Linux/macOS best practices, we will demonstrate how to install Gaffer in the `/opt/` directory. We also use `C:\software\` on Windows as an example installation path. However, you could install it to any location on your file system to which you have write and execute access.


## Installing in Linux ##
