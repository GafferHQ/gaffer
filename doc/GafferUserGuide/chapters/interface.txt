== Introduction to the Gaffer UI anchor:interface_introductionToTheGafferUI[]

Gaffer's UI is composed of a number of *editors* that can be created and arranged in panels and tabs. An arrangement of editors in panels and tabs makes up a *layout*. Layouts can be saved and restored, allowing users to configure the workspace for particular tasks.

Editors provide ways of viewing and interacting with both the script which defines the scene and the scene itself. For example, Gaffer provides editors for manipulating nodes, viewing 2D images, navigating scenes in 3D, and running python commands to modify the current working file (Gaffer session).
