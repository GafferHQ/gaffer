			<h2>Powerful</h2>
			<p>Based on a multithreaded blah blah...</p>
			<h2>Renderer Agnostic</h2>
			<p>Gaffer utilises a renderer abstraction layer allowing it to export to your favourite renderer (assuming
			   for now that your favourite renderer is either Arnold or 3Delight).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<h2>Customisable</h2>
			<p>Gaffer is built to be customisable throughout. Be it a simple
			scripted configuration tweak, complex expression, custom node
			or user interface, even a full blown application, Gaffer's open APIs enable
			you to do what you need.
			</p>

			<h2>Extensible</h2>
			<p>Indeed</p>

		</div>

		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<h2>Open Source</h2>
			<p>Distributed under the BSD license, Gaffer builds upon a
			   wealth of open-source VFX libraries including OpenEXR, OpenImageIO,
			   OpenColorIO, Cortex and of course the Gaffer frameworks themselves.
			</p>
			<h2>Unfinished</h2>
			<p>Although Gaffer is becoming more capable by the day, it still lacks
			in features and useability.
		
			Itching to fix a bug or contribute a cool new enhancement? Want to
			add support for OpenVDB, Bullet or another renderer backend?
