			<h2>Powerful</h2>
			<p>Based on a multithreaded deferred scene evaluation engine, Gaffer allows you to handle large scenes
			   and develop flexible procedural work-flows.</p>
			<h2>Renderer Agnostic</h2>
			<p>Gaffer utilises a renderer abstraction layer allowing it to export to your favourite renderer (assuming
			   for now that your favourite renderer is either Arnold, 3Delight or Appleseed).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<h2>Customisable</h2>
			<p>Gaffer is built to be customisable throughout. Be it a simple
			   scripted configuration tweak, complex expression, custom node
			   or user interface, even a full blown application, Gaffer's open APIs enable
			   you to do what you need.
			</p>

			<h2>Extensible</h2>
			<p>Feel free to add new renderers, new nodes, or integrate with your renderfarm.
			   With Gaffer derived apps you could have new types of data flowing through the node graph,
 			   such as asset dependencies or simulation operations.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<h2>Open Source</h2>
			<p>Distributed under the BSD license, Gaffer builds upon a
			   wealth of open-source VFX libraries including OpenEXR, OpenImageIO,
			   OpenColorIO, Cortex and of course the Gaffer frameworks themselves.
			</p>
			<h2>Unfinished</h2>
			<p>Although Gaffer is becoming more capable by the day, it still lacks
			   in features and useability.

			   Itching to fix a bug or contribute a cool new enhancement? Want to
			   add support for OpenVDB, Bullet or another renderer backend?
