Hear from VFX Supervisor Martyn Culpitt and Look Development Lead Mathias Lautour about how Gaffer contributed to the process:

> The rendering and shading environment is based on Image Engine's open-source node-based framework Gaffer, embedded inside Maya using Caribou, their host-agnostic Look Development & Lighting engine... With Gaffer and Caribou, they are able to drive 3Delight using a great layered based approach to shading, which allows considerable artistic flexibility using their now extensive shader library.
