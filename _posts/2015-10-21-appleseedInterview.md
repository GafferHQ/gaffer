The [BlenderDiplom](http://blenderdiplom.com) website has a nice interview with Francois Beaune, developer of [Appleseed](http://appleseedhq.net/), the open source renderer behind the short film ["Fetch"](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).

In the interview François talks briefly about the recent integration of Appleseed into Gaffer.

 > That is the work of a developer of Appleseed called Esteban Tovagliari. He did a terrific job over the last year...With Gaffer and Appleseed together we have a really nice open source lookdev application. That is something that did not exist before.
