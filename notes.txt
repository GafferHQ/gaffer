smart pointers
==============

* it's beginning to appear that smart pointers aren't great for use as parameters or return values in methods. the problems occur when those methods
get called during construction of an object - if a smart pointer to the constructee gets made during construction then the constructee is deleted
before it even finishes construction. this has been the cause of several bugs already, and they're not that easy to track down. we should consider
using raw pointers in far more places.

ui rules
========

* need to make modifier/button use consistent everywhere
	* ALT will be used purely for camera movement and nothing else
	* the apple/windows keys will not be used
* there must be no gtk in the public api for the ui library

* here is something which tells you how to set colors
	* http://ometer.com/gtk-colors.html

selection
=========

* each ScriptNode (and embedded ScriptNode) and GroupNode should have their own selection set

undo/redo
=========

	- how/where do we implement this?
		- what needs to be undoable
			- create/delete of nodes ??
			- parent/unparent of nodes
			- add/remove of dynamic plugs
			- set/connect of plugs
			- renaming of nodes and plugs
		- where undo needs to work from
			- node tweaker
			- graph editor
			- script editor?
				- trickier

* Undoable class

	* do()
	* undo()
	* script() ??
	
	* CompoundUndoable stores many actions as a single one
	
* UndoList 

* ScriptNode holds an UndoList

	* API commands which must be undoable find the appropriate
	  ScriptNode and add an Undoable object to the CompoundUndable at
	  the top of the UndoList
	  
	* UI actions push a new CompoundUndoable so that whatever actions they
	  take are batched together as one.
* interactive dragging (slider/manipulators) probably doesn't enter an undoable action for every substep, but just
an undoable event on release?

* is it possible to have a singleton undo list, and undo just bits of it nonlinearly?
	* 0 1 2 3 4 5	* undo 1 undoes 54321 and redoes 2345
					* as long as each action has refcounted pointers to the things it operates on this should work?
						* do we even need to unwind and rewind?
							* each undo element will have refcounted pointers to what it needs anyway
								* so even if the objects involved are deleted it'll do the right thing?
									* not really - you could end up connecting things back up to objects which are
									  conceptually deleted. which is an interesting point - how do we delete nodes?
									  	* i thought we could just unparent them, but that's not enough because they'll
										  remain in the undo queue, so connections and wotnot won't be broken
											* we could have del node.child implemented with a __delattr__ method
											  which performs the appropriate disconnections
											* or we could have nodes use a parentChanged callback to remove all connections
											  when they are removed
	* if we can do this then :
		* ctrl-z undoes the last action from the global list
		* shift-ctrl-z undoes the last action local to a particular control

	* is this really desirable?
		* there are plenty of nasty cases
		* will saving node states with each rendered preview give us equivalent functionality cleanly?					

serialisation
=============

* used for 

	* cut + paste
	* file save + load
	* import script
	* save selection
	
* serialisation takes a set of nodes and returns an executable string that will recreate those nodes
in a given context

	* because of the cut+paste and import methods it can't assume it has control over the context into
	  which it is going to be unserialised. if nodes clash then the new nodes should take on different names.
		
		* it'd be nice to do this script["n"] = Node(), but that doesn't really work
			* because a child called "n" may already exist
			* plus the Node constructor takes a name anyways
			
		* what if any local variables which are created and are Nodes are automatically added to
		  some parent class?
		  
		  	* a = Node( "n" )
				
			* using the "with" thing to define the parent context?
			
			* or is explicit parenting better anyway?
				
				* i think i prefer explicit parenting
					
					* but a special context object should make methods of the script
					  available as globals. so we have addChild(), selection(), save(), load() etc as free functions.
			
* this relates very closely to how we deal with the item/attribute access for GraphComponents

	* we should ditch the getattr/setattr mechanism we already have
		* masking attributes is a bad thing, and future versions will add methods which potentially
		  clash with children in existing scripts.
		  
	* we could use getitem to retrieve children - but setitem doesn't map well to addChild calls,
	  as those calls can rename the child for uniqueness

* needs to cope with multiple references to the same node
	
* serialise and read

* need to consider how to deal with missing node types, modules etc when reloading scripts
	* it would be ideal if we could somehow skip any errors but i don't know how doable that is
		- could deal with this by reading a node's worth of script at a time and executing it
			- and continuing execution on failure
			- but somehow replacing the nodes with placeholders when they fail?
			- this has another benefit - we may eventually have to read the scripts a chunk at a time
			  anyway, to get around speed issues with the python parser.
		- or could we use some special import mechanism for modules which replaces them with magic
		  stubs when they fail to load?
		  
		
script node
===========

* filename plug
* execute( string pythonCode, bool undoable ??? ) method
	* this is what all ui controls use to perform their work, and this is where the undo queue is
	implemented?????
		* i don't think so anymore
* undo(), redo() methods
* save/load methods

extended node constructors
=========================

* take keyword arguments for setting plugs and connecting things
	* AddNode( op1 = 10, op2 = 20 )
* these will form the basis of file reading
* can implement **kwargs in boost python using the undocumented class_.def_raw method
	*	for each keyword, find the plug on the node, get it as a python object, and then call the python setValue/setInput
		method passing the keyword value object as argument.
	* def_raw no longer exists :
		* here's an alternative :
			http://osdir.com/ml/python.c++/2003-01/msg00068.html
* need a way of binding node constructors for plugins without people having to use boost python

ui
==

* Basic hierarchy :

	* ScriptWindow at top level. Only one ScriptWindow per script.
	* ScriptWindow contains one Editor
	* CompoundEditor allows splittable/tabbable embedding of multiple Editors
		* All must be editing the same script
	* Can add additional floating windows at any time, but they won't have the
	  main menu bar - only the ScriptWindow has that.
	
* no menu bar?
	* waste of space
	* context sensitive menus should do
		* really? what is the context for file->open?
			* an empty graph window?
	
* fullscreen mode

* CompoundPlugWidget or GroupPlugWidget or whatever
	* String in label to summarise the state of the contents
		* Customisable with a callback function

* consistency!!!
	* hotkeys + modifiers behave similarly everywhere
	* right click is context sensitive menu
	* ctrl-right click is context sensitive menu to modify the ui
	* middle mouse don't do nuffink
		* cos scroll wheels aren't very clickable
		* maybe the scroll wheel can be used for stuff though
		
* drag and drop
	* dragging anything to the script editor should put it's path name there

* file path control
	* tab completion
	* ctrl delete removes one path level
	* right click on a path component pops up all other options at that level
		* have submenus based on alphabetic ranges when there are too many options
		  at a level
		* selecting an option changes that component
			* but attempts to keep the following components the same if they exist
				* so you can change to the same directory in a different shot

* float/int control
	* no wasting of space with the rubbish +- buttons on the right
		* up/down cursors increment/decrement the digit to the right of the cursor
	* virtual slider?
	
issues
======

plugs/parameters

	- plug has :
		- connections
		- dependencies?
		- signals
		- connectionValid() method
		
	- wrap parameters in a ParameterPlug?
		- no 
			- a ParameterisedHolder does a mapping like in IECoreMaya

nodes

	- nodes have :
	
		parent (another node)
		children
		compute
		signals

object naming / identification

	- all objects must have a (unique? - not necessarily - could be useful to have groups) id
	- use for selection, grouping, shader application etc
	- need integers for image based selection?
		- yes. id should be integer.
			- really? names are much easier to understand. plus they work nicely with regular
			  expressions.
			  	- basically we need names for users and ids for image based selection
					- can we just use a hash to make ids from names?
						- there might be collisions. is the probability of this worth worrying about?
					- can we just assign the ids in order as we render?
						- maybe. but then they won't be consistent frame to frame.
							- might be enough for tweaking things though.
					- can we have a prerender process to map names to ids consistently?
						- maybe. we'd need to run the procedurals without generating geometry
						 and grab the names out from them.
	- is id a "user:gaffer:id" attribute or a primvar?
		- an attribute. then ids can easily be applied to groups and procedurals.
		- we need Renderer::getAttr to work then.
			- RxAttribute does work for user attributes though
	
time

	- we'd like feedback for non-photoreal shit
	- we'd like dependencies at different times for shadow map generation

proxies

	- should be able to use low res standins but still have shaders work,
		deformers work etc.	

procedurals

	- everything should be a procedural?
	
	- procedurals should be able to operate on procedurals
		- this is where the SceneRenderer comes in
			- not necessarily
				- we could have a GafferProcedural base
					class with a build() method which must return a
					VisibleRenderable, and which is called by doRender()
	  
	- how to determine bounds quickly for deformers and transform caches?
	
referencing and groups

	- so one person can build a scene and release it as a script
		- and another can bring that in as a single node and apply shading and wotnot afterwards
	- should be implemented as a ScriptNode embedded within the script - so ScriptNodes can 
	  have at least one input and output plug...they'll be like groups but they'll save/load
	  to a separate file...
	- i think groups and scriptnodes need to derive from a common base class
		- which provides the selection and copy/paste/serialisation etc.

	
viewer
======

gl layer with hardware shading and shadowing

final render layer

	- with fast tweaking based on secondary output munging
		- possibly without even raising a tweaker window
			- just drag on the image with hotkeys to make a virtual
			  diffuse/spec/whatever slider for the object under the mouse
	- click raises shader editor for object
		- using id pass

norman lighting layer?

funky indirect framebuffer?

lights + shading
================

* basic point, distant, spot and environment bases
* pluggable light components to modify those lights
	* shadows (manipulator for framing etc)
		* light can have many shadows
	* falloff
	* blockers
	* gobos
	* specular reflection card for spotlight
* reflection cards
* gummi light
* a light component may be connected to any number of lights
	* but also many light components can exist on a single node for neatness?
* how do we do map generation??
* what units do we use for light intensity, diffuse reflectance etc?
	* exposure based?
		* nah - intensity value, but with a ui which can express it as exposure if desired
	* physically accurate?
	* usual nonsense?
	* force reflectances below a sum of 1? nah
* hdri creation tools needed
* multiple shadow regions and ease of map management very important
* soft shadows important
* layered shading and shader authoring important
	- make a layered shading system based on coshaders
* texture assignment and management is important
* texture painting could be important
* must be able to do lookdev in gaffer, otherwise how will you prepare anything for lighting?
* should be able to get realtime shadows in gl, and drag them around interactively
* need nice area shadow implementation using depth maps
* need to be able to constrain lights to things
* forget about supporting the old skool gl lights at all. just start with the renderman implementations
 and add gl support later on. gl support will be based entirely on glsl and maybe deferred rendering
 and skip the old lighting stuff.

features
========

* save all shader parameters with each rendered image
	
	- revert
	- mix back
	
* parameter value overlays on saved images?

* override anything in the scene at any point in the tree

	- this is essential but needs a lot of thought
	
		- we need overrides that operate like troy and dt9
			- 	override parameters of a single procedural but
				for a particular object being emitted
			-	they should be addable at any point in the tree
		- we also need shader overrides per object (primvars)
		- we also need to override procedural parameters further
		  down the tree (not per object)
		  
		- is there a common mechanism for all that?
		
		- i think this may imply a separation between nodes and
		  procedurals. nodes use plugs (non-overrideable) as their
		  value source and put procedurals in the scene. procedurals
		  use something else (parameters? member data? LayeredDictionaries?)
		  as their parameter source and these things are overrideable.

obvious things not to forget
============================

* sideways render
* overscan render (using displaywindow/datawindow difference as an option)
* playblasting
* file management
	- where do things go?
	- when are shadow maps deleted?
	- can we provide a list of all files referenced by a scene?
		- this get's tricky when filenames are calculated on the fly by procedurals
		  and shaders
		  	- perhaps they can have a method to flag resource usage
* should be able to drag and drop and sample colour from anywhere
	
colorspace management
=====================

* need unified colorspace support everywhere

	-	gtk representations of color
	-	gl representations of color
		-	imager shader? append code onto other shaders as they're compiled?
		-	render to texture and render the texture to screen with a lookup shader?
	-	image transforms
	
* implement as cube luts? then can work anywhere easily

display drivers
===============

* define a DisplayDriver interface class which is prettier than that DSpy nonsense
	* simple
	* force floats for everything? or do ints need support?
* implement DSpy * in terms of that
* implement a SocketDisplayDriver
	* can talk to any other DisplayDriver on the other side
* implement an exr driver with sideways rerotate and checkpointing

geometry support
================

* polys/subdees
	* done already
* nurbs
	* need IECoreMaya export support
* curves
	* need IECoreMaya support
* spheres, disks etc
	* need IECore support
* blobbies
	* need IECore support
* hierarchical subdees
	* hold off for the moment

pointclouds, shadowmaps etc
===========================

* vv important!
* if every scene has a hash then we can automatically recompute these guys when needed
* nodes which render these guys should output filenames which feed into the next node in line
* how to communicate the outputs of a render? perhaps a load of user options in the
Scene? and shaders etc add user options when they add themselves?

64 bit
======

* should start testing a 64 bit version as soon as possible
	* buy a cheap ass box and shove centos on it?

packaging
=========

* need build script to package up a version for release/distribution
	* have a build setup which builds everything from scratch
			
* include python and all modules within the package
* precompile .py files into .pyc
* keep mac package in the unix style for the moment
* potential layout

	- gaffer
		bin
			gaffer 	- tcsh script
					- somehow this launches some python for each app - possibly like do?
		python
			# could we just merge these in with the main directories?
			# or is it best to keep it very separate?
				- I SAY MERGE 'EM!
			bin
			lib
				python2.5
					site-packages
						pygtk
						IECore
						...
						GafferUI
		lib
			libIECore
			...
			libGafferUI
		include
			IECore
			...
			GafferUI
		test
			# why not distribute the unit tests?
			# why not have 'em as python modules in the python directory though?
			IECore
			..
			GafferUI

* here is an interesting technique lose the annoying Gaffer._Gaffer namespace that we have
