		- _Horizontal:_ The aperture gate will fit horizontally between
		the left/right edges of the resolution gate, while preserving
		its aspect ratio. If the aperture's aspect ratio is larger than
		the resolution's, the top/bottom edges of the aperture will be
		cropped. If it's smaller, then the top/bottom edges will

		resolution's, the left/right edges of the aperture will be
		cropped. If it's smaller, then the left/right edges will

		- _Fit_: The aperture gate will fit horizontally (like
		_Horizontal_ mode) or vertically (like _Vertical_ mode) inside
		the resolution gate to avoid cropping the aperture, while
		preserving its aspect ratio. If the two gates' aspect ratios
		differ, the aperture will capture extra horizontal or vertical
		scene content.
		- _Fill:_ The aperture gate will fill the resolution gate such
		that none of the aperture captures extra scene content, while
		preserving its aspect ratio. In other words, it will make the
		opposite choice of the _Fit_ mode. If the two gates' aspect
		ratios differ, the aperture will be horizontally or vertically
		cropped.
		- _Distort:_ The aperture gate will match the size of the
		resolution gate. If their aspect ratios differ, the resulting
		image will appear vertically or horizontally stretched or
		squeezed.
