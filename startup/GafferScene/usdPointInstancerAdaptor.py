# into actual Instancers. This supports how USD PointInstancers are currently loaded from
# USD files. In the future, they may be first class objects, and this will be unnecessary.

# We don't want to create a dependency on GafferUSD - this should silently do nothing if GafferUSD
# isn't available. We also don't want to import GafferUSD right away - that could lead to circular
# import problems. So instead we register this callback that will try to import GafferUSD
