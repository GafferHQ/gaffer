=== ScriptEditor anchor:interface_scriptEditor[]
Python scripts to manipulate the current Gaffer session can be entered and executed in the *ScriptEditor*. See the xref:appendices_scriptingNuggets[scripting nuggets] section for some useful examples.

The editor is broken into two sections:

* The bottom field is for entering python commands. Cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, select all, etc will work as normal - either via hotkeys or the right-click context menu.
* The top displays output from any commands executed.

To execute any code entered into the lower field of the ScriptEditor, simply select the text (either single lines, or whole chunks or code) and press `Ctrl+Enter`.
You should see the commands entered echoed in the feedback field (indicating that they were successfully executed) along with any results.
