/// Inspectors provide an abstraction for querying properties of a scene, and
/// optionally making node graph edits to change those properties. They allow a
/// small set of UI components to expose editable properties without needing to
/// know their underlying details.
///
/// Inspectors are responsible for _what_ is inspected, but the UI components
/// are responsible for the Context in which inspection happens. For example, a
/// ParameterInspector knows which parameter to inspect, but the UI provides the
/// location to inspect via the current context.
///
/// Inspectors are "EditScope aware", allowing the user to create new edits using
/// a target EditScope. One of the main contributions of the Inspector base class
/// is to encode the rules for interaction with EditScopes.
///
/// Notes for future work :
///
/// - This is temporarily in a Private namespace so that we can iterate on it
///   without concerns about ABI breakage. Intended to be public eventually.
/// - We want to generalise Inspectors so they can be used with images as well
///   as scenes. Beware any scene-centric design decisions.
/// - We want to use a TransformInspector to replace much of TransformTool::Selection.
///   This has additional requirements such as knowing the `transformSpace` that a node
///   works in. We think this information can be stored in a dedicated TransformHistory
///   class provided by SceneAlgo, avoiding any need to specialise Inspector::Result.
