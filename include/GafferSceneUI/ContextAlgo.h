/// ==============

/// generation by using the Context to store paths to the currently expanded
/// locations within the scene. For instance, this allows the Viewer show the
/// objects from locations exposed by expansion performed in the SceneHierarchy,
/// and vice versa.
///
/// By convention, an expanded location is one whose children are visible,
/// meaning that they are listed below it in the SceneHierarchy and their objects
/// are drawn in the Viewer. Conversely, a collapsed location's children are
/// not listed in the SceneHierarchy and the location itself is drawn as a
/// the bounding box of the children.
///
/// As a consequence of this definition, it is not necessary to expand locations
/// without children. For a simple node such as Sphere, it is only necessary
/// to expand the root location ("/") to view the geometry. For nodes which
/// construct a deeper hierarchy, if the name of a location is visible in
/// the SceneHierarchy, then it's geometry will be displayed in the Viewer.
