/// This class provides a dictionary of IECore::Data objects to define the context in which a
/// computation is performed. The most basic entry common to all Contexts is the frame number,
/// but a context may also hold entirely arbitrary entries useful to specific types of
/// computation.
///
/// Contexts are made current using the nested Scope class - any computation triggered by
/// ValuePlug::getValue() calls will be made with respect to the current Context. Each thread
/// maintains a stack of contexts, allowing computations in different contexts to be performed
/// in parallel, and allowing contexts to be changed temporarily for a specific computation.
///
/// It is common for Nodes to need to evaluate their upstream inputs in a modified context.
/// The EditableScope class should be used for this purpose since it is more efficient than
/// copy constructing a new Context.
///
/// \note The various UI components currently use "ui:" prefixed context variables for their
/// own purposes. These variables are expected to never affect computation, and are therefore
/// excluded from hash(). Other code may find that it too needs to ignore them in order to
/// avoid unnecessary recomputation. In the future we may explore having the UI use a separate
/// container for such variables, or a more general mechanism for variables guaranteed to be
/// unrelated to computation.
