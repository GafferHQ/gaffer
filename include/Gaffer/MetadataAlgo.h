/// Read-only-ness
/// ==============
///
/// The Gaffer API itself provides few restrictions about how and when a node graph
/// can be edited. Methods such as `GraphComponent::acceptsChild()` and `Plug::acceptsInput()`
/// do provide protection against the creation of totally invalid graphs, but beyond that
/// all responsibility lies with the user.
///
/// The "readOnly" metadata improves this situation by providing a hint that the user should
/// not be allowed to edit the target plug or node despite this underlying flexibility of the API.
/// It can be set either by implementations to protect their internals, or directly by users
/// to "lock" parts of their graph against modification by others.
///
/// In other words, the API itself provides hard constraints as to what _could_ be edited,
/// and "readOnly" metadata provides a convention as to what _should_ be edited from a user
/// standpoint.
///
/// > Note :
/// >
/// > The primary reason for implementing read-only-ness as a convention rather than a hard API
/// > constraint is that many nodes use the API to modify their internals on the fly, even when
/// > those nodes are read-only from a user perspective. For instance, a switch may modify internal
/// > connections as part of its implementation, and needs to continue to do so even when
/// > hosted inside a Reference (because the index may be promoted). In this scenario, the API
/// > must allow edits, although the UI should not.
