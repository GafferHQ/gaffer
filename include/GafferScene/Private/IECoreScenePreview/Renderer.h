/// right now so we don't have to shuffle TypeIds between Gaffer and Cortex.
///
/// \todo Improve the API, particularly in terms of ownership
/// semantics and the python bindings :
///
/// - For python code, it is too much of a burden to expect the coder
///   to delete all handles before deleting the renderer.
/// - For non-interactive modes, the "releasing the handle flushes
///   the object" semantics are also highly inconvenient.
///   We defined those semantics thinking that we'd need a way of
///   flushing for RenderMan style renders, where we must close an
///   attribute block, but only when we know the client is done with
///   an object.
///
/// A potential solution is this :
///
/// - Change `object()` etc so that they only return a handle from
///   interactive renders. We would need to add a transform argument
///   to those methods so that a single call could fully specify the
///   object, but this would let us get rid of the awkward
///   "flush on delete" semantics.
/// - Change the python bindings so that the lifetime of the object
///   handles and the renderer are tied together, or have the object
///   handles keep the renderer alive on the C++ side anyway.
