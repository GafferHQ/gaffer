#
# - Creating a new QObject to wrap the callable, moving it to the main thread,
#   and then using `postEvent()` to trigger a call to `customEvent()`, which
#   executes the callable. This triggered GIL/refcount bugs in PySide which meant
#   that the QObject was occasionally deleted prematurely.
# - Having a single QObject living on the main thread, with a signal which we
#   emitted from the background thread to schedule execution. This was more reliable,
#   but still triggered occasional PySide crashes.
# - Having a single QObject living on the main thread, and using `QMetaObject.invokeMethod()`
#   to queue a call to one of its methods. This is the approach we currently use.
