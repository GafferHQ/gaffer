	"""
	Takes two input scenes and writes a minimal USD file containing the
	differences between them. This new file can then be layered in a USD
	composition to transform the first scene into the second. This is useful for
	baking modifications made in Gaffer into a USD file for consumption in other
	hosts.

	A typical use case might be to share lookdev authored in Gaffer, with a
	workflow like the following :

	- A SceneReader brings `model.usd` into Gaffer.
	- Shaders and attributes are applied in Gaffer, using Gaffer's standard scene
	  processing nodes.
	- A USDLayerWriter is used to bake this lookdev into a new `look.usd` layer on
	  disk, with the SceneReader for `model.usd` connected to the `base` input
	  and the lookdev connected into the `layer` input.
	- A new USD file is created that layers `look.usd` over `model.usd`. This is
	  loaded into Gaffer or another host for lighting.

	> Note : To write a complete USD file (rather than a layer containing differences)
	> use the standard SceneWriter node.
