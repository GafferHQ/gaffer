	OpenColorIO LookTransform\n"
	A 'look' is a named color transform, intended to modify the look of an
	image in a 'creative' manner (as opposed to a colorspace definion which
	tends to be technically/mathematically defined).\n
	Examples of looks may be a neutral grade, to be applied to film scans
	prior to VFX work, or a per-shot DI grade decided on by the director,
	to be applied just before the viewing transform.\n
	OCIOLooks must be predefined in the OpenColorIO configuration before usage,
	often reference per-shot/sequence LUTs/CCs and are applied in scene linear colorspace.\n
	See the look plug for further syntax details.\n
	See opencolorio.org for look configuration customization examples.
