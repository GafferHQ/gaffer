			Defines a series of layers which are alpha-composited to generate the final image. Each layer
			contains all the disks within a specific radius range, allowing "foreground" disks to occlude
			"background" disks. Intended for use in approximating focal blur.

			The layers are defined by the radius values at their boundaries, which must be specified from
			low to high. Occlusion occurs between disks that are separated by at least 2 boundaries.
			Negative radii are accepted, allowing blurring to be represented both in front of and behind a
			focal plane. A reasonable value for the simulation of focal blur is therefore an exponential
			series from -maxRadius to +maxRadius, for example [ -32, -16, -8, -4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ]

			> Tip : The FocalBlur node provides a simpler and more intuitive method for defining occlusion
			layers (it uses the DiskBlur node internally).
