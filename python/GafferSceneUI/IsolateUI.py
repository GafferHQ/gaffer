	Isolates objects by removing paths not matching a filter from the scene.

	> Caution : The Isolate node does not work well with the `...` wildcard in
	> PathFilters. Because of the way Gaffer generates scenes progressively
	> from the root, the Isolate node needs to know if the filter matches any
	> descendants (children, grandchildren etc) of the current location; if there
	> are any matches then the current location is kept, otherwise it is removed.
	> When faced with `...`, the Isolate node assumes that there will always be a
	> descendant match because `...` matches anything. This can cause it to keep
	> locations where in fact there may be no true descendant match. The only
	> alternative would be to search the scene recursively looking for a true
	> match, but this would defeat the goal of lazy evaluation and could cause
	> poor performance.
