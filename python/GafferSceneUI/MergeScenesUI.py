	"""
	Merges multiple input scenes into a single output scene.
	Merging is performed left to right, starting with `in[0]`.

	By default, when more than one input contains the same
	scene location, the location's properties from the leftmost
	input are kept. In this mode, only _new_ locations are merged
	in from the additional inputs. Optionally, the properties
	can be replaced by or merged with the properties of the
	subsequent inputs.

	Sets are always merged from all inputs. Where multiple inputs
	have sets with the same name, the sets are merged into a union.

	> Caution : When `transformMode` and/or `objectMode` is not `Keep`,
	> bounding box computations have significant overhead. Consider
	> not using these operations, or turning off `adjustBounds`.
