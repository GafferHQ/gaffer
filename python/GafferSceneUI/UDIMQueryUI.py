	Gathering information about what UDIMs are present in meshes matching
	the input scene and filter, and which meshes they belong to.

	The output is a three level dictionary ( stored as CompoundObjects ), containing information about the selected UDIMs.

	The keys of the top level are all the UDIMs containing part of the target meshes.
	The keys of the second level are the meshes which touch that UDIM.
	The keys of the third level are any attributes on that mesh which match extraAttributes, and the values of the third-level dictionary are the attribute values.

	An example result, with two udims, and "attributes" set to "bake:resolution", might look like this:

	```
	{
			"1001" : {
				"/mesh1" : { "bake:resolution", 512 },
				"/mesh2" : { "bake:resolution", 1024 },
