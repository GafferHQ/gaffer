	Builds a scene by bundling multiple input scenes together, each
	under their own root location. Instead of using an array of inputs
	like the Group node, a single input is used instead, and a context
	variable is provided so that a different hierarchy can be generated
	under each root location. This is especially powerful for building
	dynamic scenes where the number of inputs is not known prior to
	building the node graph.

	Since merging globals from multiple scenes often doesn't make sense,
	the output globals are taken directly from the scene corresponding to
	`rootNames[0]`.
